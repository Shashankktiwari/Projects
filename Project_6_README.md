The attached Jupyter notebook is about a dataset on credit card fraud detection using enmsemble methods. The notebook has 6 sections.

1. Importing necessary packages and the dataset: Importing the dataset and the packages from scikit learn, keras, etc.
2. Data Preprocessing: Scaling the data and splitting it into training and testing.
3. Model building: A deep neural network with 2000 params, Random Forest and Decision Trees were fit on the training data, tested on the test data. Further, all the data was used to train and then test the model to check the performance measures.
4. Undersampling: The deep nueral network model defined earlier was used to train the undersampled data.
5. Oversampling: SMOTE was used for oversampling and the same deep neural network was used to train the data.
6. Conclusion: Findings from the best model and a walk through of the whole process was provided in this section.
