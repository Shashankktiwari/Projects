# Project 5) Predicting the likelihood of e-signing a loan based on financial history

The attached Jupyter notebook provides information about various models being built to predict the likelihood of an application to complete the onboarding process of signing a loan. The following sections provides a brief summary of the work done.

Step 1) Importing the data and data description: It contains a short description of the fields in this dataset.
Step 2) EDA: The data was analyzed for patterns and insights using histograms, correlation plots and correlation matrix.
Step 3) Data preprocessing: This section contains code for feature engineering, one-hot encoding and feature scaling using StandardScaler.
Step 4) Model Building: The following models were built: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (linear and RBF kernel), and Random Forest.
Step 5) Paramter Tuning: This section involves applying a grid search on random forest classifier using criterions such as 'Gini' and 'Entropy'.
Step 6) Conclusion: This section provides a brief summary of the best model and mentions the future course of action using this model.
