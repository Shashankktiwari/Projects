# Project_1_Classification

The attached Jupyter notebook is about a dataset on breast cancer classification using Support Vector Machines. 
The notebook has 6 sections.
1) Problem statement: Understanding of the fields included, the target variables and the end goal of the project.
2) Importing the data: Importing the dataset and converting it into a dataframe.
3) Visualiations: Correlation matrix and heatmaps plotted to understand the distribution of data w.r.t. the target variable.
4) Model building: The data was partitioned into training and testing and SVM model was trained and tested on the data. The model performance was evaluated using confusion matrix.
5) Model improvement method-1: Normalizing the dataset and fitting the SVM model once again on the new data to test for improvements. 
6) Model improvement method-2: Optimizing paramters ( 'C' and 'gamma') in SVM to increase accuracy.
