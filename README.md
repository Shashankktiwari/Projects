Project 2: Classification using Deep Learning

The attached Jupyter notebook is about a fashion dataset containing 70,000 records of images. (28*28 pixels) stored in the form of numbers between 0 (black) and 255 (white) and a target column with values corresponding from 1 to 10 for different products like sandals, sneakers, pullovers, shirts etc.

The notebook has the following sections:

1. Problem statement: The problem statement briefly summarizes the description of the records.
2. Importing the data: The jupyter notebook was run on Google Colaboratory and this section deals with importing the necessary files needed for smoothly running the notebook.
3. Data Visualization: This section briefly dives into plotting the image data from the dataset and comparing it with the labels provided. There are codes for viewing a single image and a grid of images.
4. Training the Model: The data was divided into training, testing and validation. This section further contains code on how the CNN model was built and the addition of convolution (without dropout), flattening and hidden layer. The total number of epochs are 50. 
5. Evaluating the model: This section deals with confusion matrix and classification report.
6. Conclusion: This section contains model performance report and steps that can be taken to improve the CNN.
