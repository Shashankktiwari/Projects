# Project_4_Churn_prediction

The attached Jupyter notebook is about a dataset on customer churn prediction by building a supervised learning model in Python. There are 6 sections in this notebook.

1. Problem Statement: A brief introducttion about the problem, end goal, and the categories of the datafields included.
2. Importing the data: importing packages, datasets and description of the fields.
3. Data Preprocessing: removing NaN, Feature Histograms, Feature Piecharts, correlation plot and correlation matrix.
4. One hot encoding and feature selection: Getting dummies, removing some features, balancing the data and normalizing the dataset.
5. Model building & Model validation: A logistic regression model was built on the data that provided 61% accuracy. Performance metrics were calculated. Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) was performed to identify top 20 features giving the same accuracy as the orignal model to improve speed.
6.Final results & conclusion: Combining the results into a dataframe and outlining areas of imporovement for the model.
